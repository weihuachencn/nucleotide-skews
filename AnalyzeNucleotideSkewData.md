This section allows you use our model to :
  * analyse the nucleotide skew data,
  * dissect contributions attributed to replication, transcription and translation,
  * plot all main figures and extended data figures 2~6,
  * do statistical tests used in the main text and supplementary text

How-to:
  1. download a zip file from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwieX-ApVZM5ME11eUxBS0JLc28&authuser=0) and unzip it; a folder 'nucleotideSkews2014Rproject' will be created
  1. launch your "R" application; if you don't have one, please download it from [here](http://www.r-project.org/). Set the working directory to "/path/to/nucleotideSkews2014Rproject".
  1. copy and paste the contents of the R source code file : 'nskews\_june2014.R' into your R program.

**NOTE:**
  * a few R libraries including "ggplot2", "caper" and "ape" are required to make the figures; please install them if you haven't done so.
  * all required data and additional R scripts are included.

#summary analyse nucleotide skew data

This section allows you use our model to :
    * analyse the nucleotide skew data, 
    * dissect contributions attributed to replication, transcription and translation, 
    * plot all main figures and extended data figures 2~6,
    * do statistical tests used in the main text and supplementary text

How-to:
  # download a zip file from [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwieX-ApVZM5ME11eUxBS0JLc28&authuser=0 here] and unzip it; a folder 'nucleotideSkews2014Rproject' will be created
  # launch your "R" application; if you don't have one, please download it from [http://www.r-project.org/ here]. Set the working directory to "/path/to/nucleotideSkews2014Rproject".
  # copy and paste the contents of the R source code file : 'nskews_june2014.R' into your R program.

*NOTE:* 
  * a few R libraries including "ggplot2", "caper" and "ape" are required to make the figures; please install them if you haven't done so.
  * all required data and additional R scripts are included.

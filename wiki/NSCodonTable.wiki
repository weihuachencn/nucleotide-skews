#summary Nucleotide skews in coding regions are shaped by a trade-off inherent in the codon table

This section allows you to use the processed data to produce the statistical tests, figures and supplementary figures except SupFigure 1.

  # download a zip file from [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwieX-ApVZM5T1Y3cFZOY3ptTFk/edit?usp=sharing here] and unzip it; a folder '5_skews2014_rawdata_and_Rscripts_for_www' will be created
  # launch your "R" application; if you don't have one, please download it from [http://www.r-project.org/ here]. Set the working directory to "/path/to/5_skews2014_rawdata_and_Rscripts_for_www".
  # copy and paste the contents of the R source code file : 'nucleotide_skews_2014.R' into your program.

NOTE: a R library "ggplot2" is required to make the figures; please install it if you haven't done so.
